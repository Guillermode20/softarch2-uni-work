SCENARIO PART 2
It is now your second month working at Northumbrisoft. You and your team have successfully built a
prototype conference application, which greatly impressed a potential client.
Your company has hired several more team members, meaning you now have time to focus on the
system architecture.
The Product Manager has updated the requirements as follows:
1. For the frontend apps, the product manager wants you to prioritise the web and mobile apps.
Other versions such as an AR app and Digital Displays may be needed in the future.
2. The apps must be able to show information about different conferences. This could be different
occurrences of the same conference (e.g. CHI 2025, CHI 2026, etc.) or completely different
conferences (e.g. ICRA 2025, SfN 2025, etc.).
3. It must be possible for a user with an administrator account to add a new conference. It must
also be possible for an administrator to update information about existing conferences.
4. The data for each conference must be held in a separate database.
5. In addition to content and author information, each database should contain information about
the conference schedule, including the dates and location of the conference, and at what time
and in which room each item of content is being presented. The apps must present schedule
information.
6. It must be possible for users to view information about current and upcoming conferences. It
must also be possible to access information about conferences after they have happened.
7. Users must create a user account before accessing data in the app. A user should have a single
account that they can use for accessing information about any conference. They should use the
same account for the mobile app as they do the web app.
8. Users should be able to store their own, personal “notes” about items of content. Each note
should be associated with specific item of content. For example, a user might make notes during
a conference presentation about the content being presented. Users should be able to create and
access their notes in both the web and mobile app.
9. The system should collect engagement data including how many monthly active users the
different frontend apps have and how often information for each conference is being accessed.
The product manager is going on holiday and wants you to plan an initial version of the architecture
while they are away. They will not be available to answer questions. They have told you that you can
be flexible with the requirements, including deciding which to prioritise and deciding if additional
requirements are needed. They want you to draw upon your own expertise and to produce an initial
version of an architecture document that they and the rest of the team can discuss with you when
the product manager returns from holiday. The architecture document should focus on what you
see as the key issues and concepts and does not need to give significant detail for specific elements.
ASSESSMENT TASK
You should produce a software architecture description document for the conference application
outlined in Scenario Part 2. Your software architecture description document should be based on the
4+1 View Model of architecture (Kruchten, 1995).
Your document should have the following sections
Cover page. This should state your name, student id, and the word-count of your document. It
must also state what software you have used to produce any diagrams or images in the
document. It must also state if you have used generative AI when working on the assignment.
Introduction. This should give a brief description of the system and introduce the 4+1 View
Model of architecture.
Proposed architecture. This should use the 4+1 View Model of software architecture, covering
the logical view, process view, development view, physical view, use cases and use case test plan.
Conclusion. This should give a short summary, describe any strengths and limitations of your
architecture, and describe any important questions that would still need to be addressed before
the architecture can be finalised
References. If your work draws on any sources of information, including academic papers and
reports, and any online sources, they should be referenced in a consistent and appropriate
format (such as Harvard).
Appendix. You can include additional documents in an appendix if you wish. Any work you
include in an appendix is unlikely to contribute to your overall mark. Only include an appendix if it
provides essential context for understanding the main body of the report.
Diagrams should be included in the report where appropriate. These should be embedded into the
report itself. Each diagram in the report should have a figure number and caption.
An image file for each diagram used in the report should also be placed in a “diagrams folder” and
submitted separately. This folder should also contain any source files used to produce the images.
The diagrams you use should give a broad overview of your proposed architecture. They do not need
to cover everything in depth. You can use as many diagrams as you wish, but these must be
appropriate and relevant for your architecture. All diagrams included in the document must be
discussed in the text. You may lose marks for including diagrams that are not explained in the
document and/or do not make a clear contribution to the description of your architecture.
Your Software Architecture description document should focus on breadth rather than depth. It
should have broad, high level-coverage of key parts of the system.
